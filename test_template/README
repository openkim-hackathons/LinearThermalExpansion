This LAMMPS Test uses the {{TEST_DRIVER_NAME}} Test Driver to compute the
linear thermal expansion coefficient of a {{lattice}} lattice of Al atoms at
{{temperature}} K at a pressure of {{pressure}} MPa.

Makefile
     Makefile to build executables with GNU or Intel compilers (empty here).

README
     This file.

dependencies.edn
     File that lists the KIM lattice constant Test from which this Test needs
     to query the result for the current Model being run against.

runner
     Executable that calls the Test Driver's executable.

pipeline.stdin.tpl
     Template file which is used to query for the relevant lattice constant and
     pass it to the runner on stdin.

kimspec.edn
     Metadata file specific to KIM.
